## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

In the future, for component projects like this, I could take the time to generalize the component more and bring the data in as props rather than just meeting the style requirements.
